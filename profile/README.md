## 🎯 About This Organization

FNUQ-Project is a collection of open-source projects dedicated to creating modern, macOS-native virtualization tools. We believe virtualization should be fast, simple, and enjoyable to use.

### Our Projects

| Project | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **https://github.com/FNUQ-Project/FNUQ-Core** | 🟢 Active | Core hypervisor engine and CLI |
| **https://github.com/FNUQ-Project/FNUQ-UI** | 🟡 Planning | Modern SwiftUI interface |
| **https://github.com/FNUQ-Project/FNUQ-UEFI** | 🟡 Planning | Native UEFI implementation |
| **https://github.com/FNUQ-Project/FNUQ-Docs** | 🟡 Planning | Documentation and guides |

### Why We Exist
One very simple reason is that we developed an operating system (a microkernel operating system called E-comOS). For security, we used UEFI + a 64-bit kernel. However, QEMU, unfortunately, has "less than ideal" support for UEFI. We were too lazy to develop another UTM or Broadcom's VMware Fusion—they're too large. So, we decided to rewrite a QEMU-like virtual machine software that has both a visual interface and a command-line interface for ease of use, to test our kernel.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FNUQ-Project/FNUQ-Core.git
cd FNUQ-Core
swift build -c release
```

### Your First VM
```bash
# Create a VM with sensible defaults
fnuq create my-vm --memory 4 --disk 20

# Start it
fnuq start my-vm

# Check status
fnuq list
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

FNUQ projects follow a modular architecture:

```
FNUQ-Project/
├── FNUQ-Core/          # Hypervisor engine (Swift CLI)
├── FNUQ-UI/           # SwiftUI interface (Future)
├── FNUQ-UEFI/         # Native UEFI (Future)  
└── FNUQ-Docs/         # Documentation
```

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift 5.5+
- **Virtualization**: Hypervisor.framework
- **Platform**: macOS 11.0+
- **Build**: Swift Package Manager
